# Tutorial that compatible with the gstreamer 1.18

This is the [tutorial](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/gstreamer/gst-plugins-rs/-/tree/main/tutorial) for
gstreamer-plugins.

Since some plugins can't compile in my environment, I have to modify the code. My gst version is `1.18.4`, so features in `1.18` are used.

Only modified [rgb2gray](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/gstreamer/gst-plugins-rs/-/tree/main/tutorial/src/rgb2gray). I've lost all the git history, so just use `diff` if you want to know what has been changed.
